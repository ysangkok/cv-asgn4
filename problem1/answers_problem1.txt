How do you compute the variance of a single principal component?
Why can the variance be obtained in that way?

>  The variance of a single principal component u_i is lambda_i*u_i where 
lambda_i is the eigenvalue (of the covariance matrix) associated to u_i
It is possible so because the principal component is a eigenvector of the 
covairiance matirx
